                        Consciousness is the psychology of awareness. 
                        The term refers to your individual awareness of your unique thoughts, 
                        memories, feelings, sensations and environment.  Your conscious 
                        experiences are constantly shifting and changing. For example, 
                        in one moment you may be focused on reading this sentence, 
                        then on the position you're sitting, then onto how excited you 
                        are to have your next meal. These shifting thoughts can change 
                        dramatically from one moment to the next, but your experience 
                        seems smooth and effortless.

                                To distinguish between brain regions involved in reporting 
                                about a conscious perception from those involved in generating 
                                a conscious perception, we need to explain why activity in any 
                                region should be associated with consciousness. For that, we need 
                                a general theory of perception describing what the brain does in 
                                order for us to experience consciousness. In the 19th century, 
                                German polymath Hermann von Helmholtz proposed that a brain is a 
                                prediction machine. Everything that we see, hear and feel is nothing 
                                more than the brains best guess about the causes of sensory inputs. 
                                Sensory information from the body connects at the thalamus before 
                                going to the visual cortex, causing a heavy flow of information from 
                                the thalamus to the visual cortex. However, there is 6 times as much 
                                traffic flow in the opposite direction suggesting that at any one 
                                moment, what we experience as seeing relies less on the light streaming 
                                into our eyes and more on what's already inside our heads.
                                Also, if we think about this logically, the brain has no direct access 
                                to the outside world. Instead, it receives ambiguous and noisy sensory 
                                signals that it must decipher. Perception must therefore be a process 
                                of interference in which sensory signals that are coming in through 
                                the body are compared with prior expectations about the way the world is. 
                                Together, this forms the brain’s optimal hypothesis of the causes of 
                                the sensory signals. To summarise, what we see is the brain’s best 
                                guess of what is out there.

                                Sensory signals enter through receptors such as the retina and 
                                as they progress deeper into the brain, each stage of processing 
                                becomes increasingly sophisticated. The classical view of perception 
                                is that the brain processes information in a <q class="tooltip">bottom-up <span class="tooltiptext">
                                Processing information as it is coming in from your eyes

                                direction. The Helmholtzian theory inverts this, proposing that 
                                signals flowing into the brain from the outside world only carry 
                                prediction errors - the difference between what the brain expects 
                                to see and what it receives. Therefore, using the Helmholtz theory, 
                                perception involves the minimization of prediction error within 
                                the brain’s sensory system by continuously updating the brain's 
                                predictions. In this view, perception is a controlled hallucination.<br>
                               
                                <br>A number of experiments have shown that consciousness depends more

                                interrupt top-down signalling across the visual cortex and found that this

                                signals were left intact.

                                In 1987, scientist Bernard Baars proposed the global workspace theory. 
                                He hypothesized that consciousness stems from a separated network of 
                                neurons that are widely spread throughout the cortex. This network receives 
                                information from separate sensory regions of the brain and puts it all together 
                                - filtering out and contradicting/unnecessary pieces of information to 
                                create a unified and smooth sense of reality.<br>
                                
                                <br>An arguably more interesting theory is the integrated theory of 
                                consciousness (ITT for short), proposed by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi 
                                in 2004. According to this is theory, consciousness is linked to integrated 
                                information which can be represented by the mathematical quantity ‘phi’ (Φ). 
                                The part of the brain that supports our consciousness has high Φ and is 
                                therefore highly conscious. Parts with low Φ have little consciousness 
                                and parts with no Φ have no conscious.
                            </p>
                            <h2>What is meant by information?</h2>
                            <p>
                                The information that matters for consciousness is information a system 
                                has about it itself, which is measured by 
                                the number of possible states it could undergo. The brain consists of billions 
                                of neurons, allowing it to have an endless combination of neurons firing 
                                and not firing. However, knowledge of the current state of the brain 
                                cancels out most of the possible combinations; only a few combinations 
                                can cause the current combination and there are only a few combinations 
                                it, in turn, could cause. This is what gives the brain high information 
                                about itself, achieving IIT first requirement for consciousness.
                            </p>
                            <h2>What is meant by intergration?</h2>
                            <p>
                                IIT’s next requirement for consciousness is integration. Integration 
                                measures how much of the information of a system depends on the interconnections 
                                between a system’s parts. To determine this, the question ‘how much information 
                                is lost by cutting the system in two?’ is asked. In the brain, every neuron 
                                is connected to thousands of other neurons, forming intricate structures. 
                                If the brain were cut in two, a lot of this structure would be lost, along 
                                with any information that depends on it. This shows that it is a highly integrated 
                                system and that it’s information is not stored in chunks of the brain, but 
                                are instead interconnected.<br>

                                <br>However, having high Φ does not fully explain the brain’s consciousness. 
                                IIT’S third and final requirement is that a conscious system must be a maximum of Φ.  
                                This means, that it must there must be no overlapping systems that have a higher 
                                level of integrated information that the part that is responsible for consciousness, 
                                including other parts within the brain itself.<br>

                                <br>If ITT is correct, we would be able to measure the consciousness of any system by measuring its Φ.
                                It would also solve a significant portion of the <q class="tooltip">easy problem <span class="tooltiptext">
