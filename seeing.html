                        About a third of the brain’s cortex is engaged in vision, 
                        and when you open your eyes, billions of neurons and trillions 
                        of synapses are engaged. They are creating the object, shapes, 
                        colours and motion that we see in real-time to construct a reality. 
                        However, we don't construct the whole world at once, we construct 
                        what we need at the moment.

                    <p>
                        This structure serves as the brain’s primary visual cortex. 
                        The primary visual cortex is a structure essential to the 
                        conscious processing of visual stimuli. It aids the brain 
                        to determine spatial information and colour data.

                        to what it’s seeing. Without V2 we would still be able 
                        to see, but we would not understand what our eyes took in.

                <p id="i1">
                    Vision provides a lot of information to the brain and in some cases, 
                    it can be overwhelming. For example, skier Mike May lost his vision at 
                    3 years old due to a chemical explosion and recalls the incident as 
                    not seeming like a big deal. 40 years later, Mike underwent surgery 
                    to restore the physical damage done to his eyes. After the surgery, 
                    the overwhelming amount of visual information heavily confused his brain. 
                    All the visual information had no meaning or worth as the brain had developed 
                    without the chance to 'see' the world, so each piece of information had no value. 
                    He could not recognise his children as he had no face recognition whatsoever 
                    and proved to be a worse skier with eyesight than he was without as his depth 
                    and colour perception were off. This experience explains all the elements that 
                    have to be in place for the brain to construct a visual reality.
                    <br><br>If from birth we weren’t able to interact with the world, in theory, 
                    we’d never be able to see.  Our senses depend on each other and our reality 
                    is built by comparing the streams of data. These streams of data are then put 
                    together to create the current moment and many moments constructs a reality. 
                    However, if we block one sensory input from the brain it will still be able 
                    to construct a reality, however different. Furthermore, if we took away all 
                    sensory inputs, reality would still exist, just not to us.
