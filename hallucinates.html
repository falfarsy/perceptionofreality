                    <p id="g-info">
                        There are similar processes between hallucinations and the brain’s 
                        perception in interpreting sensory data, as in, what exists in the 
                        real world does not always line up with what our brain perceives as 
                        reality.<br><br>Richard Gregory, a British psychologist, proposed 
                        that perception is hypothesis testing. This means that the brain 
                        is continually testing its predictions about what reality is through 
                        interacting with sensory signals which can then act to refine or 
                        disprove these hypotheses.

                        <p>
                            Donald Hoffman, an American cognitive psychologist, ran thousands of evolutionary 
                            game simulations containing randomly chosen worlds and organisms in hope of 
                            answering the question, ‘Does Natural selection really favour seeing reality as it is?’. 
                            In almost every simulation, organisms that see none of reality but are just tuned to fitness, 
                            drive all of the organisms that perceive reality as it is to extinction. 
                            He explains this result using a desktop interface as a metaphor; 
                            'We can add/delete icons, edit files, search the internet and so forth on a desktop. 
                            All of this is there to hide the reality of the hardware of the computer, 
                            ie, the logic gates, circuits etc. So the idea is that evolution has given us an 
                            interface that hides reality and guides adaptive behaviour and in the long run, helps us to survive.'

                            We all have an internally generated reality inside our brain that’s constantly updated by 
                            information from our senses. The brain makes up assumptions of what we are seeing using 
                            our internal model, which has been built up from years of experiences. This is used 
                            instead of rebuilding a reality from scratch at every moment. Normally, our brains are so 
                            good at defining, updating and correcting our perception of reality that we are unaware of it. 
                            However, under certain conditions, we can see the process at work.

                        <p>
                            The illusion we see is our internal model, not the new information that is coming through our eyes. 
                            Our internal model is built on a lifetime's worth of experiences with faces that stick out. 
                            When confronted with a hollow face, our model simply sees what it expects to see.

                <p>
                    In the real world, colour doesn’t actually exist. When electromagnetic radiation hits an object, 
                    some of it bounces off and is captured by our eyes. We are able to distinguish between millions of 
                    combinations of wavelengths, but it’s only inside our heads that this is interpreted as colour.
                    The visible spectrum of light (red to violet) only constitutes of less than 1/10 000 000 000 
                    (ten trillionths) of the electromagnetic spectrum. This does not take away the fact that the 
                    rest of the spectrum exists and is passing through our eyes, we just don’t have the special 
                    biological receptors to pick up on it. Therefore, the part of reality we can see is limited by our biology.
